# Business 

I've been reading The Minimalist Entrepreneur by Sahil Lauingia, the founder of Gumroad. In his book, he promotes a concept about pursing profit-first for entrepreneurship, whereas I learnt entrepreneurs are responsible for genearting businesses that can run without YOU in school. But they are not guiding me anywhere.

Use time wisely. I spent so much time in figuring out the domain and servers. But it didn't work out. I found out the pricing of Ghost changed. Cheaper. I was like, to save my time and have a sense of peace, I decided to invest this money. Let's say I manage this site for 12 months and it'd cost me $108. It should be okay. 

# Job

I'm not quite sure about why it is so hard to get a job. Honestly, I've tried my best and applied for 180+ jobs now.
