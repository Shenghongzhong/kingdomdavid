## I'm visual approver 

I got a job offer as a data analyst. Everything is great except the company is in Hull, 3 hours 14 minutes away from London, isolated from any place else, 1 hour 4 minutes train to York.

But the office is near sea, alought the water is dirty yellow due to the population. I think deeply about the resistance of moving into a new place, as I noticed myself that I don't like any other places except East London, the house I'm living in, the church I've been part of, even though I have been struggling with making a living and pay my rent. Man, I just couldn't leave for many reasons. I used to think it's because I got the cheapest rent, which is true. Yet, it isn't the main reason. 

The main reason would be, I only can think of, the sinking cost. I've been contributing too much to the community and place I'm part of. Who would paint the house entirely and thoroughl? Me. Who would constantly cook for a bunch of people without asking for any return? me. Even for this, what I've done is still not enough. 

If Financial Times gives me offer as a sales intern, I'd probably take it, no matter what my friend would say. Sometimes a friend's opinionated characteristic is annoying. I talked about the plan of studying another master's degree in computational art,and the friend devalues the intention and questions my decision-making abilities without really understanding why and friends' support. 

I started to think about the position of the friendship. I feel it unnecessary to continue as the friend compares me to another; whatsmore, I've pointed out problems with current self-employeed jobs (No sickday, no creativities) whereas the friend questions me about the professionalism. 

It's time to reserve my thoughts, as not everyone will think from your perspectives. I guess I'd pretend everything is fine at any place.
