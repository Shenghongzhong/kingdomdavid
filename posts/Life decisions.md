# The Beginning of the End

I'm not sure about where  I should begin with. Since April, I lost almost everything. It was a scary moment that I thought I would have been sleeping in the street like any other homeless people. 

I wasn't mental, or addicted to drugs but I chose to negotiate with a frim which offered me a role as a data analyst. It was great, despite it's a role with less relevant projects and opportunities, that they would pay me really well by the skills and work experience I have. Unfortunately, the only issue was that they are outside London. There are lots of things I could comprise but the only one thing would be the lifestyle. I came to  the UK 5 years ago and have been living in East London since. It's more like my second home or just home. It was too difficult to cut it off and just move out, especially I have got a good deal with a thriving house. 

I failed to negotiate with them and as a result, they withdrew the offer. All of sudden, I had no job opportunities and income to survive in London. Fortunately, my landload was very kind and gave me a freelancing opportunity to help them with their manual order processing task, plus the experience of working in church as a bodyguard. 

But I didn't realise how bad these jobs are until I did. They're those jobs which no one wants to do it and enjoy doing it. You don't get paid if you don't do it, meaning you have to constantly work if you want to pay bills and rent. It's an awful feeling when you can't have a sick dayoff, just because you have to pay for bills. Jesus said don't worry about money and tomorrow. My Lord, I had tried weeks of sandwiches and no dinner at nights. I don't worry but I was about to kill myself slowly and gradually. 

I expressed my diffulties in public, aka in social media platforms, as I would expect some kinds of help could come along, or at least people wouldn't have felt awkward when I asked for if they were hiring. I was wrong. It wasn't they didn't want to help, but the macro economy in the post-covid environment is just too awful. relutant people are desperated to look for jobs, whereas conservative people are at the same job for the wait-and-see strategies, which creates a dead water zone. If you are in, you are in, vice versa.

Anyway, retrospectively speaking, one of main factors for my decision-making is the community I've been living in. However, I don't think the community is the same, or me has changed. The chuch I was part of becomes something I couldn't recognise anymore. Even like now, I'm leaving for other churches, places. 

No one would care about it that much, since my existence is too little to identify. Since no one would really care about me as an Asian and struggling to immgrigate, after that I have been trying to contribute as much as I could, I cook many meals and tried my best to make friends who all left. I was quite ill last Sunday which I exciplictly said I couldn't work on Sunday and being told I have to work because I was booked for the time,and I didn't know whom I can ask for help. Literally, none. 

I heard people would say, "well David, then it's probably your call to make a move. Then why didn't you just move out." 

Yes, I would have said no before I experienced the recent time of being unable to pay for bills and rent. 

It's about time now.
